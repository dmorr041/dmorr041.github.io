          Carrier 360 by J.B. Hunt is an all-in-one solution for transportation
          carriers of any size. Whether you're a small trucking company with a
          few trucks and a single Department of Transportation (DOT) number, or
          a corporation as large as Amazon, you can sign up with our platform
          and receive access to our loadboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          We integrate directly with Dial-a-Truck (DAT), and offer competitive
          rates and a full auctioning system for our loads. Users can place
          competitive bids on loads, book loads at fixed pricing models, track
          their loads from the tendering process through the delivery of the
          load, and even handle payments within our app.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the more notable features I worked on was integrating Google
          Maps into the app, so carriers and drivers can more accurately see the
          loads near them, and any pit stops they might need along the way. We
          also have a scoring system for loads measuring things like delivery
          time, update frequency, and other transit related metrics, as well as
          SMS, email, in-app and push notifications for reminders and alerts on
          significant events during the freight lifecycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application is built using React Native for mobile devices and
          Angular for the web. We use a containerized microservices
          infrastructure server-side, written in Spring Framework and Java. We
          manage our pipelines via Azure, and our Kubernetes resources are
          deployed top-nav GKE Clusters. We also come complete with a full
          eventing architecture utilizing both AMQ and Kafka.

          Open Research is a Google Chrome Extension that integrates the Open AI
          Chat Completions API to make research more readable and understandable
          to the average layman. Highlight text you would like to better
          understand in the browser, then simply right-click to open the context
          menu and hit translate and a GPT interpreation of what you are reading
          becomes available in the sidebar.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was built because of a common problem my friends and I
          faced during 2020 - we all found ourselves reading more reasearch
          papers, particularly around Covid, but most of us didn't have a
          background in research or in medicine, so digesting and understanding
          that material proved difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's built using the Google Chrome Extension APIs, which utilize plain
          old HTML, CSS, and browser-based Javascript.

          I'm a first generation American - both of my parents are from
          Kingston, Jamaica.

          I'm a Software Engineer with 5 years of experience, and I'm passionate
          about learning new languages and technologies. I've worked mostly with
          React Native, Spring, and Docker/Kubernetes.

          I'm currently a Lead Developer for Carrier 360 by J.B. Hunt, the
          all-in-one flagship product for the largest transportation company in
          North America.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned the fundamentals of computer systems and programming at
          Florida International University in Miami, where I'm originally from,
          during my Bachelor's of Science program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miami is a melting pot of culture, and I was blessed to have worked in
          hospitality prior to starting in tech, where I developed a love for
          food and the culinary world. I also enjoy cycling, strength training,
          and like most developers, a fair bit of videogames.
