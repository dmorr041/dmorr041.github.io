          Carrier 360 by J.B. Hunt is a complete solution for transportation
          carriers of any size. Whether you're a small trucking company with a
          few trucks and a single Department of Transportation (DOT) number, or
          a corporation as large as Amazon, you can sign up with our platform
          and receive access to our loadboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          We integrate directly with Dial-a-Truck (DAT), and offer competitive
          rates and a full auctioning system for our loads. Users can place
          competitive bids on loads, book loads at fixed pricing models, track
          their loads from the tendering process, through the delivery of the
          load and even handle payments within our app.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had the pleasure of integrating Google Maps into the app, so
          carriers and drivers can more accurately see the loads near them, and
          any pit stops they might need along the way. We also have a scoring
          system for loads measuring things like delivery time, update
          frequency, and other transit related metrics, as well as SMS, email,
          in-app and push notifications for reminders and alerts on significant
          events during the freight lifecycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application is built using React Native for Mobile devices and
          Angular on the web. We use a containerized microservices
          infrastructure server-side, written in Spring Framework and Java. Our
          Kubernetes resources are managed and deployed via GKE Clusters, and we
          come complete with a full eventing architecture utilizing both AMQ and
          Kafka.

          I'm a Software Engineer with 5 years of experience, and I'm passionate
          about learning new languages and technologies. I've worked mostly with
          React Native, Spring, and Docker/Kubernetes.

          I'm currently a Lead Developer for Carrier 360 by J.B. Hunt, the
          all-in-one flagship product for the largest transportation company in
          North America.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned the fundamentals of computer systems and programming at
          Florida International University in Miami, where I'm originally from,
          during my Bachelor of Science program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miami is a melting pot of culture, and I was blessed to have worked in
          hospitality prior to starting in tech, where I developed a love for
          food and the culinary world. I also enjoy cycling, strength training,
          and like most developers, a fair bit of videogames.
